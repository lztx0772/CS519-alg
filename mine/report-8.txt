1(a)
O(klogk+nlogk). At first we build a heap, use klogk time, then we get n elements from the heap, use nlogk time.so the total time complexity is O(klogk+nlog(n+k))

1(b)
The first method is use heapify to make a heap, it can reduce the O(klogk) to O(k), so that O(k+nlog(n+k)).
second is use qselect choose the first n element, with the first optimal, time is O(k+nlogn)
2
O(nw), I make a table which contain routes that make amount reduce to 0. so it is O(nw)

[NEW QUESTIONS]
5. Did you like the Midterm? If not, which part(s) do you dislike the most?
	No, I don't like Midterm. filling in the programs are the parts I don't like, There are thousand of methods to implement the problems, it is really hard to know what to write on the paper.
6. Do you feel this HW (as a second-chance to midterm or as a take-home quiz) is helpful?
	yes, it is. I am not that strong to come up with an algorithm immediertly, it is really confused sometimes, I need to test my code to make my answer right.
