0. Compare two recursive implementations of fib (naive vs. memoized).
   (a) What's exact complexity of naive in theory?
   (b) Let's say you know it's O(a^n); can you curve-fit to determine the approximate value of a?
   (c) Does this value match the theoretical complexity?

(a) for naive it is O(n) complexity
	for memoized, it's O(((1+√5)/2)^n) 
(b) after using the gnuplot, the result of approximate value is 1.39

(c) almost fit the theoretical complexity.


1. complexity of top-down (max_wis()) and bottom-up (max_wis2()) solutions are O(n)


2.  What's the complexity of this DP?
   O(n^2)

   What's the name of this famous number series?
   Catalan number

5. Which part(s) of the course you like the most so far?
I like the lecture, and the discussions in canvas are very useful.
And I perfer professor to give us more tips about how to compute complexity.

6. Which part(s) of the course you dislike the most so far?
Always the quizzes, and exams.
