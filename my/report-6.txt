1.
   (a) Describe an exhaustive solution, and analyze compleixty (might be exponential).
   A(0) = 0
	A(Y) = max { A(Y - 1), max { pj +A(Y - wj) | wj ≤ Y } }
   O(nw)
   (b) Describe a greedy solution, and analyze complexity.
   complexity is O(n)
   (c) Show a counterexample to the greedy solution.
   if A(2,4) B(5, 9) it will lead a wrong answer
   (d) Theoretically, is the top-down solution faster, or the bottom-one one faster?
   (e) Empirically, which one is faster? (Try some long random lists)
