1. 
input permutation:
worst-case:1,2,4,6,7,8,9
best-case:6,2,1,4,8,7,9

2.
time complexity:
worst-case:O(logn)
best-case:O(1)

3.
false, because when we can't use binary search in linked-list, because we still need cost O(n) time to reach that node in linked-list, so it couldn't reduce time complexity.
